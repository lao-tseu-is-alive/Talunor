# Changelog

All notable changes to Talunor are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Talunor uses a `0.MINOR.PATCH` scheme where **each completed build layer bumps
`MINOR`**. Iteration 1 (a conversational agent with memory) completes at `0.5.0`.

This changelog doubles as a teaching log: each version records not just *what*
changed but the *lessons learned* while getting there.

## [Unreleased]

- Layer 2 — Memory API: `Remember` / `Recall` (KNN + cosine threshold) and a
  short-term ring buffer.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14 — Layer 1: DB foundation

The persistence substrate for Talunor's memory, proven end to end
(load extensions → embed in-DB → KNN retrieval).

### Added

- `internal/memory` — a `Store` over SQLite (`mattn/go-sqlite3`, cgo) with two
  loadable C extensions from [sqliteai](https://github.com/sqliteai):
  - `sqlite-ai` (`ai.so`) runs a GGUF embedding model **in-process**, so
    embeddings are produced with plain SQL — no external embedding service.
  - `sqlite-vector` (`vector.so`) stores embeddings as `FLOAT32` BLOBs in an
    ordinary column and provides brute-force KNN via `vector_full_scan`.
- Embedding model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (F16 GGUF), **384 dimensions**, cosine
  distance.
- `internal/version` — build identity (`Version`, `Commit`, `Date`), commit/date
  injected via `-ldflags` from the Makefile.
- `cmd/doctor` — a smoke test that embeds a small corpus, stores it, and runs
  KNN queries to confirm semantic retrieval works.
- `Makefile` — `make deps` fetches both extensions and the model into `ext/`
  (gitignored); `make doctor`, `make build`, `make clean`, `make distclean`.

### Design decisions

- **Single connection** (`db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)`): the loaded model, the
  embedding context, and `vector_init` are all *per-connection* state in these
  extensions. Pinning to one connection keeps that state valid and sidesteps a
  class of concurrency bugs — a fine trade-off for a single-user agent.
- **In-DB embeddings** over provider embeddings: fewer moving parts, offline,
  and a fixed 384-dim space independent of which chat LLM is used.
- Flat `memories(id, kind, role, content, embedding, created_at)` table for now;
  turns vs. document chunks are distinguished by `kind`, not separate tables.

### Lessons learned

1. **`sqliteai/sqlite-vector` is *not* the `vec0` virtual-table API.** That
   `vec0` syntax belongs to a different project (`asg017/sqlite-vec`). sqliteai's
   extension stores vectors as `FLOAT32` BLOBs in normal columns and searches
   with `vector_init(...)` + `vector_full_scan(table, col, query, k)`.
2. **`mattn/go-sqlite3`'s `LoadExtension(lib, "")` is broken for a default entry
   point.** It forwards `""` as a non-NULL empty C string, so SQLite calls
   `dlsym("")` and fails with an *empty* `undefined symbol:` message. Fix: pass
   the entry point explicitly — `sqlite3_vector_init`, `sqlite3_ai_init`.
3. **`vector.so` does not link libm.** It expects libm symbols (`fmaxf`, `exp`,
   …) to be resolvable in the global scope. Being merely a `NEEDED` dependency of
   the Go binary is not enough; the reliable fix is
   `dlopen("libm.so.6", RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL)` at init (`cgo_link.go`).
4. **`sqlite-ai` v1.0.4 requires `embedding_type`** in
   `llm_context_create_embedding(...)`. The embedding flow is
   `llm_model_load(path,'gpu_layers=0')` → `llm_context_create_embedding('embedding_type=FLOAT32,normalize_embedding=1,pooling_type=mean')`
   → `llm_embed_generate(text,'json_output=0')`, which returns a `FLOAT32` BLOB
   directly usable for storage and as a query vector. `llm_model_n_embd()`
   reports the dimension.

### Requires

- `CGO_ENABLED=1` and a C toolchain (gcc).
- `make deps` before first build (downloads ~52 MB of extensions + model).
